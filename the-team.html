Over the past year, my most said quote other than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt the school year over yet‚Äù has been ‚ÄúYou should come to the CTA coffeehouse!‚Äù because I am a strong believer in shameless promotion. BTW, we probably have a coffeehouse soon so you should come (: SO YAY, can‚Äôt wait to do amazing things with this council again this year!!!</p>

I don‚Äôt know what im doing with my life or even how to be a normal human being. I try to broaden my horizons whenever I can, and learn new things whenever I can. I love to jump at new opportunities to experience new things. My workaholic lifestyle has helped me learn a whole bunch of new things like learning to play four instruments and using adobe programs with superb knowledge. I try to be an open person who doesn‚Äôt limit themselves based on judgement. I also sound really dry and dead all the time but I promise you im not.</p>
