(I’m the tall one) This is my third year on the council, and I’m so excited to see all the 🔥🔥🔥 events we’re going to host this term. Asides from planning crazy, fun events for CTA, I enjoy watching cheesy rom-coms, reading cheesy books, and eating cheese. My life-long goal is to get an amazing job in Marketing, be happy, and settle down with lots and lots and lots of dogs. You definitely won’t want to miss out on what we have planned for this year, so come out to our events and say hi!</p>

I’m a Grade 12 IB student attending Bayview Secondary School whose interests include drinking milky beverages and regretting it immediately (I'm lactose intolerant) and imitating Linda from Bob’s Burger’s catchphrase: “Alriiiight!” I also have dreams of going to law school at Columbia University and becoming a successful lady lawyer in the heart of NYC. I love CTA because we're all about promoting youth artistic expression, and I'm all about that. Hit me up @taniaparkinglot on Snapchat if you wanna chat about CTA or if you want cute pics of my forehead!!!!</p>

		<p class="bios mmm">Hello! I’m Brittany Young and I’m in grade 11 at Markham District High School. I’m super excited (like night-before-Christmas excited) for my second year on CTA! I enjoy planning events, both in and outside of clubs, and drawing (but I’m too much of a perfectionist to actually finish anything). Over the past year, my most said quote other than “I’m hungry” or “Why isn’t the school year over yet” has been “You should come to the CTA coffeehouse!” because I am a strong believer in shameless promotion. BTW, we probably have a coffeehouse soon so you should come (: SO YAY, can’t wait to do amazing things with this council again this year!!!</p>

I have a profound love for stationery (esp muji pens and pastel highlighters), aesthetic notes, and binge watching TV shows. I also tend to take very long naps to compensate for not sleeping enough at night, am too lazy to wear my contacts half the time, and pour the milk before the cereal (don't hate me). This will be my second year on CTA and I'm super excited to work with the exec team for another year so we can continue to unleash our creativity :)</p>

This is my first year working on CTA and I'm really excited to be working with such a great group of people! My interests and hobbies include basketball, volleyball, swimming, science (its nerdy, I know) and doing nothing at home (I'm super lazy, I only move when I play sports). I dream of being a researcher in a lab somewhere in the world, discovering something the world has never seen! I know that this year is going to be an amazing year for CTA so keep an eye out for our events!</p>

		<h2>Bobby Wong <small>Sponsorship</small></h2>
		<p class="bios mmm">I really like to think im good at stuff, until I compare my work to teens from Markham. I like to seem to know what im doing but I really don’t. I don’t know what im doing with my life or even how to be a normal human being. I try to broaden my horizons whenever I can, and learn new things whenever I can. I love to jump at new opportunities to experience new things. My workaholic lifestyle has helped me learn a whole bunch of new things like learning to play four instruments and using adobe programs with superb knowledge. I try to be an open person who doesn’t limit themselves based on judgement. I also sound really dry and dead all the time but I promise you im not.</p>
